# AI Foreign Policy Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to augment foreign policy decision-making through the use of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The AI assistant helps accelerate research and analysis, particularly focusing on US foreign policy. 

### Project Overview:
Foreign policy requires thorough analysis of diverse sources, a process that typically takes significant time and effort. This AI Foreign Policy Assistant leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and analyze large volumes of data faster and more efficiently than traditional human research teams, offering a quicker path to informed decision-making.

### Key Features:
- **Data Ingestion**: The assistant can ingest historical and real-time data from sources such as books, news articles, Wikipedia pages, and speech transcripts.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The assistant uses **standard RAG** to retrieve relevant pieces of unstructured text and provide it as context to the LLM. This helps ground the modelâ€™s responses in concrete data.
- **Contextual Summaries**: The retrieved information is summarized and presented to the LLM for enhanced comprehension and more insightful foreign policy recommendations.
- **Foreign Policy Insights**: The assistant is capable of responding to hypothetical foreign policy scenarios, covering perspectives on military, diplomatic, and economic issues, as well as evaluating global implications.


### Use Cases:
- Assisting foreign policy researchers by quickly retrieving and analyzing relevant data for decision-making.
- Providing context-aware, detailed responses to hypothetical foreign policy scenarios.
- Offering a time-efficient solution for understanding complex international relationships and their implications.

### Conclusion:
The AI Foreign Policy Assistant demonstrates how standard RAG can be used effectively to augment decision-making in foreign policy, offering a scalable and efficient way to process and analyze large volumes of unstructured text.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies.
3. Ingest historical and real-time data from a variety of text sources.
4. Interact with the AI assistant and explore its responses to hypothetical foreign policy scenarios.
